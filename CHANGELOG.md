# Changelog

Notable changes to ByeTex. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com); versions follow semver.

## [0.3.0] — unreleased

Agent-in-the-loop hardening + distribution. The MCP server grows from 7 to
**11 tools**, the visual-fidelity loop becomes one command, and ByeTex ships as a
Claude Code plugin.

### Added
- **Agent tools (7 → 11), MCP + CLI parity:** `validate` (Stage-0 input oracle),
  `compile` (typst → PDF with structured errors), `render` (→ per-page PNGs),
  `explain` (per-node LaTeX → Typst map).
- `byetex convert -c <code>` / `-` (stdin) — convert a snippet to stdout, no files.
- `convert_fragment` now honours its `context_hint` (math hints wrap the fragment
  so bare math converts as math, not an unknown text command).
- `byetex review <paper>` — one-command visual grading packet (truth↔typst page
  images) for the `byetex-visual-grading` skill.
- Two-layer fidelity regression gate: `scripts/fidelity_gate.sh` (deterministic
  structural metrics) + `scripts/findings_diff.py` (vision-graded findings).
- **Claude Code plugin:** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `marketplace.json`,
  `.mcp.json`, and a SessionStart hook; skills restructured to
  `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
- Distribution: `install.sh`, a Homebrew formula (`packaging/byetex.rb`), and
  crates.io metadata.

### Changed
- CLI package renamed `byetex-cli` → `byetex` so `cargo install byetex` works
  (binary name and the `crates/byetex-cli` directory are unchanged).
- `byetex_core` gains shared `validate`, `compile`, and `snippet` modules,
  mirroring `diagnose` (pure logic + an orchestrator both surfaces share).

## [0.2.0] · [0.1.0]

See the git history (`git log v0.1.0..v0.2.0`). Highlights: the hand-rolled
LaTeX → Typst core, project mode, the `diagnose` repair loop + skills, per-class
fidelity, and the corpus reaching 100 % compile.
