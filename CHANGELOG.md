[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com); versions follow semver.

## [0.6.3] — unreleased

### Added
- **Generic thesis/report cover page for `\coverimage` + `\makecover`** (Phase 4). Thesis
  and report classes (e.g. `tudelft-report`) define a designed cover page — a
  near-full-bleed cover image plus a banner carrying the title / subtitle / subject /
  author — that ByeTex previously dropped entirely (the directives `\coverimage`,
  `\makecover`, `\subject` were unhandled). ByeTex now detects `\coverimage{path}` (the
  asset is resolved and copied into the project output via the existing AssetRef
  plumbing) and, on `\makecover`, emits a generic cover page as the document's first
  page: a full-page `#image(..., fit: "cover")` with an overlaid dark title banner. Gated
  on chapter-bearing classes so articles/papers are unaffected; degrades gracefully to a
  banner-only page when the cover image is missing. The bespoke per-class art (logo, exact
  banner colours/fonts) is approximated, not replicated. The tudelft thesis now renders a
  cover page that was previously dropped.
- **Beamer overlays become touying incremental builds** (Phase 3c). Previously every
  overlay collapsed to its final state (everything shown at once); now beamer build
  specs drive sub-slide reveals: `\pause` → `#pause`; a sequential
  `\item<1->`/`<2->`/`<3->` list reveals one item per sub-slide (a `#pause` is injected
  between the spec-bearing items); a slide-top-level `\only<n>{X}` → `#only("n")[X]` and
  `\uncover`/`\onslide`/`\visible<n->{X}` → `#uncover("n-")[X]`. Reveals work inside the
  native `#grid`/`#block` that columns/blocks emit; only a reveal nested inside another
  reveal (which touying panics on, "Unsupported mark `touying-fn-wrapper`") is rendered
  collapsed. Incremental (`<+->`) and multi-segment (`<1,3>`) specs are also rendered
  collapsed for now. All gated on the beamer document class; non-beamer overlay handling
  is unchanged. The beamer-demo deck grows from 5 to 9 pages as the three-item
  "Why Scaling Laws?" frame and the `\only<2>` of "Loss Model" expand into build steps.

### Changed
- **Beamer theme colors map onto touying, and section-divider slides are gated**
  (Phase 3b refinement of the touying conversion). A detected beamer "structure" color
  — from `\setbeamercolor{frametitle|structure}{fg=…}` or `\usecolortheme{name}`
  (`beaver`/`crane`/`default`/…) — is now mapped to the metropolis accent via
  `config-colors(primary: …)`, so the header progress line / accent matches the deck's
  theme instead of metropolis's default orange. Detect-don't-hardcode: no override is
  emitted when the source defines no theme color. Section-divider slides are now gated on
  the deck actually installing one: a `\section` produces a standalone divider slide only
  when the preamble has `\AtBeginSection` (or `\setbeamertemplate{section page}`), matching
  real beamer; otherwise the section becomes a navigation-only heading
  (`= X <touying:hidden>`) that no longer renders a spurious extra page. The beamer-demo
  deck drops from 8 pages (title + outline + 3 dividers + 3 content) to 5 (title + outline
  + 3 content), matching the LaTeX truth.

### Added
- **Beamer decks now emit native Typst `touying` slides** (Phase 3a). A `beamer`
  document is converted to a `touying` presentation with the `metropolis` theme — a real
  slide framework with a dark header bar carrying the frame title, a footer with the slide
  number, and the accent progress line — instead of the old hand-rolled
  `#set page(paper: "presentation-…")` plain-Typst slides. Mapping:
  `\documentclass[aspectratio=…]{beamer}` + `\title`/`\subtitle`/`\author`/`\institute`/`\date`
  → `#show: metropolis-theme.with(aspect-ratio:, config-info(…))`; `\frame{\titlepage}` →
  `#title-slide()`; `\begin{frame}{T}` / `\frametitle{T}` → a `== T` slide; `\section{X}` →
  a `= X` section-divider slide; `\subsection` → a `=== ` in-slide heading;
  `\tableofcontents` → `#outline(title: none, indent: 1em)`; a bare `\frame{…}` →
  `#slide[…]`. Columns/blocks/`\alert` are unchanged (they already produce valid Typst that
  works inside touying slides). Overlays remain collapsed to their final state (no
  `#pause`/`#only` is emitted); real overlays and theme-color mapping are deferred to later
  phases. The compile gate resolves `@preview/touying:0.7.3` from the package cache.

## [0.5.23] — unreleased

### Fixed
- ACL author blocks: route through the NeurIPS-style author parser (same `\textbf{Name
  \textsuperscript{n}}` + `\textsuperscript{n} Institution` legend). Real institutions are now
  kept and keyed per author, a `\thanks{Correspondence…}` note is no longer mis-used as the
  affiliation, and `\thanks`/`\footnotemark` no longer leak into names (Phase 2).

## [0.5.22] — unreleased

### Fixed
- ACL papers: the title now renders at `\Large` (1.44em) per `acl.sty`, matching the truth,
  instead of the oversized neutral 1.5em it inherited (the title was visibly too large).

## [0.5.21] — unreleased

### Fixed
- Chapter-bearing layout (`\section` level under `\chapter`, `\tableofcontents`→`#outline`,
  `\frontmatter`/`\mainmatter` page numbering) is now decided by whether the document
  actually uses `\chapter` — detected in the entry-file prepass and via a project-wide scan
  of `\input`'d files — instead of a brittle class-NAME substring heuristic. Fixes false
  positives (`booklet`/`workbook` were treated as chapter-based) and false negatives (a
  custom chapter class whose chapters live in `\input`'d files; health-check P1).

## [0.5.20] — 2026-06-22

First release since v0.3.0 — it bundles all the 0.4.x/0.5.x work below. Highlights:

- **Beamer presentation support** — a LaTeX beamer deck converts to Typst slides: frames
  (one page each), `columns`→grid, blocks→titled `#block`, the title slide, overlays
  collapsed, per-deck theme colors (detected, not hard-coded), and 4:3 / 16:9 geometry.
- **Book/report/thesis support** — chapter/section heading hierarchy, `\tableofcontents`→
  `#outline`, `\frontmatter`/`\mainmatter` page numbering, `longtable`→`#table`, `\subtitle`,
  `\appendix` lettering, and isolated `\begin{titlepage}`.
- **Agent surface** — `diagnose <.typ>` leaked-LaTeX scan, a `warnings.json` sidecar from
  `diagnose --project`, and new `byetex-beamer` / `byetex-book` skills (15 skills total).
- **Converter fixes** — author-block marker leaks, `\addtocounter`/theorem-`\label`
  underscore leaks, `\text{$…$}` inner-math, the `\abstract`/algorithm-block recipes, and
  many more (see the per-version sections below).

### Fixed
- `\begin{titlepage}` is now isolated on its own page (pagebreak before + after) instead
  of its content flowing into the following frontmatter/chapter (round-6 dogfood A6).

## [0.5.19] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- `\appendix` now resets the heading counter (`#counter(heading).update(0)`), so the
  first appendix is A — previously appendices continued the body count (e.g. D/E after
  three chapters; round-6 dogfood).

## [0.5.18] — 2026-06-22

### Added
- New `byetex-book` skill documenting how ByeTex converts book/report/thesis classes
  natively (ToC, page numbering, chapter/section hierarchy, long tables) and the few
  constructs to fix by hand — so agents stop re-implementing what works (round-5 T3).
  Linked from `byetex-getting-started` (doc-type routing) and the skills INDEX.

## [0.5.17] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- Book/report `\frontmatter`/`\mainmatter` now switch page numbering (roman → arabic
  reset to 1) via Typst `#set page(numbering:)` + a page-counter reset, instead of being
  dropped (round-5 dogfood T-frontmatter).

## [0.5.16] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- Book/report/thesis `\tableofcontents` now renders a `#outline` of the chapters/sections
  instead of being dropped (extends the beamer ToC to chapter-bearing classes; round-5 T-toc).

## [0.5.15] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- Book/report/thesis heading hierarchy: in a chapter-bearing class (`book`/`report`/
  `memoir`/KOMA/thesis), `\section` now renders at heading level 2 under `\chapter`
  (subsection at 3, …) instead of being flattened to level 1 (round-5 dogfood T2).

## [0.5.14] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- `\subtitle{…}` is now rendered under the title for ALL document classes (report, book,
  thesis, article-with-subtitle-package), not just beamer — it was dropped elsewhere,
  losing the subtitle on title pages (round-5 dogfood T1).

## [0.5.13] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- `longtable`/`longtable*`/`xltabular` (multi-page tables, common in theses and papers)
  now render as a Typst `#table` instead of being dropped wholesale; the page-break
  markers (`\endhead`/`\endfoot`/…) are dropped no-ops (round-5 dogfood). The table
  `\caption` is not yet carried over.

## [0.5.12] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- `byetex diagnose --project`/`--flat` now writes a `<stem>.warnings.json` sidecar next to
  the `.typ`, so an agent repairing a diagnosed project (e.g. the dogfood harness) can see
  silently-dropped constructs instead of only compile errors (round-4 dogfood R2).

## [0.5.11] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- `\text{…}` inside math now re-converts an embedded `$…$` to Typst math (e.g.
  `\text{if $x_t = y$}` in a `cases()` condition) instead of leaving the dollar signs
  literal. Handles escaped `\$`, unbalanced `$`, and quote/backslash escaping safely
  (round-4 dogfood A5).

## [0.5.10] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- `\label{key_with_underscore}` inside a theorem-like environment no longer leaks its
  tail (`_to_denoiser`) as body text — tree-sitter truncates the key at the first `_`, so
  the whole `\label{…}` is now consumed (round-4 dogfood A2).

## [0.5.9] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- Beamer `\section`/`\subsection` between frames now starts its own section slide
  instead of the heading bleeding onto the previous slide (round-4 B6).

## [0.5.8] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- Beamer `\tableofcontents` now renders a section outline (`#outline`) on the slide
  instead of being dropped — the Outline slide lists the deck's sections (round-4 B-toc).

## [0.5.7] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- `\addtocounter{c}{-1}` (and the counter-setter family) no longer leak as literal body
  text when a value breaks the parse — a negative step parses as a greedy ERROR node; the
  command + its args are now dropped while following content is preserved (round-4 A1).

## [0.5.6] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- Beamer `\subtitle{…}` is rendered under the title on the title slide instead of being
  dropped (round-4 dogfood B-subtitle).

## [0.5.5] — 2026-06-22

### Added
- New `byetex-beamer` skill documenting how ByeTex converts beamer presentations
  natively (frames, columns, blocks, overlays, theme colors) and the few constructs to
  fix by hand — so agents stop re-implementing what the converter already does. Linked
  from `byetex-getting-started` and `byetex-unsupported-environment` (round-4 dogfood R1).

## [0.5.4] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- Beamer `\alt<spec>{default}{alternative}` now shows the default arg and drops the
  spec + the alternative (was leaking the `<spec>` and rendering both args).

## [0.5.3] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- Beamer title slide shows the author and `\institute` as plain centered lines instead
  of the academic-paper superscript-numbered affiliation footnoting.

## [0.5.2] — 2026-06-22

### Added
- Beamer frame titles now render in the deck's theme color, DETECTED per deck:
  `\setbeamercolor{frametitle|structure}{fg=…}` + `\definecolor` are honored exactly,
  `\usecolortheme{name}` maps to the theme's structure color, and a stock deck falls
  back to beamer's default structure blue (instead of a hard-coded blue for all decks).

## [0.5.1] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- Beamer aspect ratio: decks now default to the beamer-standard **4:3** slide page and
  honor `\documentclass[aspectratio=169]{beamer}` (and 16:10/14:9) for widescreen,
  instead of always forcing 16:9. (Class-option parsing now keeps `key=value` values.)

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-22

Autonomous-dev cycle: a self-improving loop that raises converter fidelity and
hardens the agent surface, dogfooded by a fresh model each tick. Highlights below.

### Added
- **`byetex diagnose <file.typ>`** — diagnose an already-edited Typst file IN PLACE
  (compile + map errors, no re-convert), so an agent's fixes survive; wired into the
  CLI, the MCP `diagnose` tool, and the agent_brief / repair-loop guidance.
- **ACL venue page geometry** — auto-detect `acl.sty` and apply a4 paper, 2.5cm
  margins and a 10pt body (the values the venue forces over the class options).
- **`tcolorbox` recipe** — a reusable `#block`-based translation in the
  `byetex-unsupported-environment` skill, plus `needs_manual_review` skill routing.
- **overset family** — `\overset`/`\underset`/`\stackrel`/`\accentset` → Typst
  `attach(base, t|b: script)` (previously dropped both args).

### Fixed
- array `>{…}` column-decorator alignment now propagates to the Typst column.
- Numerous body-leak bugs: `\footnotemark[N]`, heading underscore `\label`, TeX
  register/penalty `=NNNN` tails, `\ExplSyntaxOn…\ExplSyntaxOff` expl3 regions,
  `\setminted`/counter-command arguments.
- `figure*` / `table*` now span both columns in two-column layouts.
- `byetex-math` skill: `op(..., limits: #true)` (bare `true` doesn't compile) +
  `chevron.l/.r` over deprecated `angle.l/.r`; `byetex-getting-started` gained a
  fidelity-phase section.
- `algorithm` floats now render their `algorithmic` pseudocode instead of an empty
  placeholder.
- `\abstract{…}` **command** form (class-redefined, e.g. bytedance) is now captured
  like the `abstract` environment instead of being dropped.
- Author-block marker leak: `\footnotemark[N]` (and other `\cmd[opt]` markers) no
  longer leak their `[N]` as literal text next to author names.
- NeurIPS multi-author blocks (`\textbf{Name}$^{n}$ \quad …` with a `$^{n}$`
  affiliation legend) now split into separate authors instead of one concatenated name.
- `byetex-using-warnings-json` skill: actionable triage table for `unsupported_command`
  (most are benign drops) instead of a circular self-pointer; range note clarified.
- `byetex-unsupported-environment` skill: `algorithm`/`algorithmic` pseudocode recipe
  (captioned `#figure` + numbered `#enum`, with a `\STATE`/`\FOR`/`\IF` line mapping).
- `byetex diagnose <file.typ>` (in-place) now also scans for **leaked LaTeX**
  (un-converted `\command`s and `\[..\]` markers that compile but render literally),
  surfacing fidelity issues that `typst compile` reports as clean.
- `byetex-getting-started` skill documents the new in-place leaked-LaTeX scan so agents
  discover it.

### Added
- Foundational **beamer** (LaTeX presentations) support: the `beamer` class is detected
  and each `frame` renders as its own page with a bold slide title (`\begin{frame}{T}`
  or `\frametitle{T}`) instead of being dropped. (Columns, blocks, and the title slide
  are follow-ups.)
- Beamer `columns`/`column` → a Typst `#grid` (column widths mapped to `fr` ratios),
  so two-column slide layouts keep their content instead of being dropped.
- Beamer `block`/`alertblock`/`exampleblock` → a titled `#block` (accent-colored header
  + left rule) instead of being dropped.
- Beamer `\frame{…}` command form renders as a slide (short-form slides no longer
  dropped); `\frame{\titlepage}`/`\titlepage` resolve to the auto-emitted title slide.
- Beamer decks now render on a landscape 16:9 slide page (presentation geometry: larger
  base font, tight margins, ragged-right) instead of the us-letter article layout.
- Beamer overlay specs (`\item<1->`, `\pause`, `\only`/`\uncover`/`\onslide`/`\visible`/
  `\alert`) are handled: content is shown unconditionally and the `<…>` spec no longer leaks.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-15

Agent-in-the-loop hardening + distribution. The MCP server grows from 7 to
**11 tools**, the visual-fidelity loop becomes one command, and ByeTex ships as a
Claude Code plugin.

### Added
- **Agent tools (7 → 11), MCP + CLI parity:** `validate` (Stage-0 input oracle),
  `compile` (typst → PDF with structured errors), `render` (→ per-page PNGs),
  `explain` (per-node LaTeX → Typst map).
- `byetex convert -c <code>` / `-` (stdin) — convert a snippet to stdout, no files.
- `convert_fragment` now honours its `context_hint` (math hints wrap the fragment
  so bare math converts as math, not an unknown text command).
- `byetex review <paper>` — one-command visual grading packet (truth↔typst page
  images) for the `byetex-visual-grading` skill.
- Two-layer fidelity regression gate: `scripts/fidelity_gate.sh` (deterministic
  structural metrics) + `scripts/findings_diff.py` (vision-graded findings).
- **Claude Code plugin:** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `marketplace.json`,
  `.mcp.json`, and a SessionStart hook; skills restructured to
  `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
- Distribution: `install.sh`, a Homebrew formula (`packaging/byetex.rb`), and
  crates.io metadata.

### Changed
- CLI package renamed `byetex-cli` → `byetex` so `cargo install byetex` works
  (binary name and the `crates/byetex-cli` directory are unchanged).
- `byetex_core` gains shared `validate`, `compile`, and `snippet` modules,
  mirroring `diagnose` (pure logic + an orchestrator both surfaces share).

## [0.2.0] · [0.1.0]

See the git history (`git log v0.1.0..v0.2.0`). Highlights: the hand-rolled
LaTeX → Typst core, project mode, the `diagnose` repair loop + skills, per-class
fidelity, and the corpus reaching 100 % compile.
